Required skills: React (hooks and functional components), CSS, JSX

Please see interaction video attached as project file for interaction and layout details.

We need a swipeable view component with the same interactions as displayed in the video. 
There should be a top pill-based selection (Live, Today, Yesterday, This Week) 
and multiple sub sections for each pill that are swipeable with touch or mouse drag. 
Clicking a pill should rapidly scroll to the correct sub-section. 
You can choose to use whatever supporting open source libraries, 
however we ask that there are no CSS dependancies (MaterialUI for example), CSS can be inline for convenience. 
This can be discussed if there is an inconvenience.

**You do not need to implement the charting functionality, 
an image for demo purposes where the charts should be can suffice for now.

We prefer React functional implementation with hooks over a component based one.
